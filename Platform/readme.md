Hello Dr. Somasundaram, 
 
Thank you for your time today, it was great to speak with you. 
 
Here is the link to the Magic Quadrant for DevOps Platforms which shows both GitLab and Harness as leaders in our MQ. 

Per Gartner policy, we don’t do competitive assessment between open-source tools. Here is a balanced and fair comparison between Gitea and GitLab - https://www.virtualizationhowto.com/2024/11/gitea-vs-gitlab-which-one-for-home-lab/

Also, attached the CNCF whitepaper on platform engineering. 

Wishing you a great rest of your week! 
 
Kind Regards,
Manju
