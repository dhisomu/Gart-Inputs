Hi Gaurav, thank you for setting up the call with Dr Somasundaram Balasubramaniam today.
I have attached the SAFe Epic for interest, but it would be better to define features at the level required with your stakeholders.
The links for story splitting methods are How to Split A User Story  and SPIDR.
I have linked below to the research that we discussed. I will ask Karan if he can forward research that you cannot access.
User Story Essentials 
User stories provide an effective approach to capturing user needs, promoting stakeholder collaboration and enabling the rapid delivery of high-quality products. Technical professionals must support their agile teams by becoming skillful in writing, estimating, refining and implementing user stories. 

How to Develop Effective User Journey Maps 
User journey mapping is an effective collaboration process for aligning cross-functional teams around a shared, holistic view of the user experience. Software engineers building UX should create, integrate and evolve user journey maps in product development to deliver solutions that delight users. 

Scrum Essentials 
Scrum is the most popular implementation of agile. However, the apparent simplicity of Scrum’s lightweight framework masks implementation complexity. Software engineers must develop deep expertise in Scrum to harness its full potential for delivering business value. 

Product Owner Essentials 
Product owners are critical to building successful customer solutions using agile development. Software engineers in a product owner role must employ a broad range of product management practices to solve complex business problems and maximize the value produced by Scrum teams. 

Scrum Master Essentials 
The Scrum Master is accountable for the effective and efficient implementation of the Scrum framework at a team and enterprise level. Software engineers in a Scrum Master role must develop the skills and experience necessary to enable and empower high-performance teams.
